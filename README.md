# Angular7_WorkingWithObservables

      Pre-requisite
1) First, we need to install Node.js in our machine. 
2) Now, install Angular cli using following command:
          npm install -g @angular/cli
3) To create an Angular application, use
          ng new app_name
4) Now, go to the project directory and use the below command to run the application:
          ng serve (or) ng serve -o (or) npm start


      Working with the application
      
After cloning or downloading, change the directory of the project in CMD (Command Prompt) and enter the command "npm install" and press Enter.

With the above command, all the packages upon which our application is dependent will be downloaded as "node_modules" folder.
